Data Exploration Exercise
Part 1: Where is the data?
Below is a list of places where data is all around you.
Your job: For each venue, brainstorm what kinds of data you could collect there. There's no wrong answer—just think like a detective!

Venues:
Grocery Store

Airport

Hospital

School

Coffee Shop

Movie Theater

Gym

Music Streaming App

Online Clothing Store

Library

You can add your own venue if you'd like—get creative!

Part 2: How is the data represented?
Now take the data you brainstormed and classify how it is represented.

Some common types of data:

Numbers (e.g. temperature, price, time)

Text (e.g. names, job titles, descriptions)

Numbers + Letters (e.g. flight numbers, license plates, user IDs)

Yes/No or True/False (e.g. is the order complete? is the seat taken?)

Choices from a list (e.g. type of coffee, payment method, genre)

For each piece of data you came up with, identify how it's stored or shown.
