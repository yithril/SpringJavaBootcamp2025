Formula: PV = PMT Ã— [(1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r]

Where:

    PV is the present value of the annuity.
    PMT is the monthly payout amount.
    r is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and then divided by 100 to convert to a decimal).
    n is the total number of monthly payments (number of years to pay out multiplied by 12).

Accept the monthly payout amount (PMT), expected interest rate (r), and number of years to pay out (t) from the user as input.

Calculate the monthly interest rate (r) by dividing the annual interest rate by 12 and then dividing by 100 to convert it to a decimal.

Calculate the total number of monthly payments (n) by multiplying the number of years to pay out by 12.

Use the formula to calculate the present value (PV) of the annuity.

Display the present value of the annuity to the user.
