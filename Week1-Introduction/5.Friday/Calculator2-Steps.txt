Accept the initial deposit (P), annual interest rate (r), and number of years (t) from the user as input.

Calculate the daily interest rate (r) by dividing the annual interest rate by 365 to account for daily compounding.

Use the following formula to calculate the future value (FV) of the deposit:

FV = P(1 + r/n)^(n*t)

    FV is the future value of the deposit.
    P is the initial deposit amount.
    r is the annual interest rate (in decimal form, e.g., 0.0175 for 1.75%).
    n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year (assuming daily compounding, n would be 365).
    t is the number of years the money is invested for.

Use this formula to calculate the total interest earned.

Total Interest = FV - P
