Calculation Steps
    
Accept the principal (P), interest rate (r), and loan length (n) from the user as input.

Calculate the monthly interest rate (r) by dividing the annual interest rate by 12 and then dividing by 100 to convert it to a decimal.

Calculate the number of monthly payments (n) by multiplying the loan length in years by 12.

Use this formula to calculate the monthly payment (M).

M = P[r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n-1]

Where:

    M is the monthly payment.
    P is the principal amount (loan amount).
    r is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and then divided by 100 to convert to a decimal).
    n is the number of monthly payments (loan length in years multiplied by 12).

Use this formula to calculate the total interest paid:

Total Interest = (M * n) - P
