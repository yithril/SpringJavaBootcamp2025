Programming Tips

Do not overthink this! We are goingto assume the user is going to give us reasonable input.
We haven't learned techniques to handle what happens if the user does something weird.
So don't worry about it!

You will need to use the scanner to get user input.

Remember! The scanner has many different methods to handle if the user is going to give us
a string, a double, an integer, etc.

scanner.nextLine() is for strings
scanner.nextInt() is for integers
...and so forth

A good strategy is to gather all of the different pieces of information from the user using the scanner,
and THEN do your calculations.

If you think about it, this project can really be broken down into three major steps:

1. Ask the user a series of questions to get the data we need.
2. Run the equation using the data we collected and get a result.
3. Print the result to the screen.

Also remember, just because you learned something does NOT mean that it must be applied to the project.
The project uses some of the things we learned during the week, and doesn't require others. 
For example, switch(case) may or may not be necessary for the project. If not, don't use it. 
That's like real programming.
