Part 1: String Concatenation with +

Create two String variables: one for a person's name, and one for their favorite hobby.

Print a sentence using + string concatenation that says something like:
"Alex enjoys painting in their free time."
You don't have to print this exact sentence, it's just an example.

Part 2: Using printf with multiple types

Create three variables:

a String for a movie name

an int for the release year

a double for the rating (like 8.5)

Use System.out.printf to print a sentence like:
"Inception was released in 2010 and has a rating of 8.5."
