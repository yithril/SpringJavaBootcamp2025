Instructions

    Create a new program. You probably want a folder for morning warmups since this won't be going up to github.

    Inside the main method of your project, do the following:

    a. Create a Scanner object to read user input. You will need to import the java.util.Scanner class at the beginning of your program.

    b. Prompt the user to enter the current weather by displaying the message: "How's the weather today? (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy): "

    c. Read the user's input as a String and store it in a variable (e.g., userInput).

    d. Use if/else-if/else statements to check the value of userInput and provide the following responses based on the weather conditions:
        If userInput is "Sunny" (case-insensitive), print: "It's a great day for outdoor activities!"
        If userInput is "Cloudy" (case-insensitive), print: "The weather is a bit uncertain."
        If userInput is "Rainy" (case-insensitive), print: "Don't forget your umbrella!"
        If userInput doesn't match any of the above conditions, print: "Sorry, I'm not sure about that weather type."


    Test your program by running it and entering different weather conditions as input. Make sure it provides the correct responses for each condition.

    Try entering a weather condition that is not "Sunny," "Cloudy," or "Rainy" to see how your program handles it.

    Once you've completed the program and tested it thoroughly, you're done!

BONUS: Can you re-write your code with a switch statement?
