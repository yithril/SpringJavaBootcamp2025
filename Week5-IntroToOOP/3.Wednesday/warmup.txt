Let's practice writing method signatures and getting used to the vocabulray. 
For the following methods, you can just write the signature, you don't need to write
the inside of the method (the implementation, or logic). This is to see if you remember how to structure the method signature.

1. Write a public method called findMax that takes an array of integers and returns the largest value as an int.

2. Write a private method called printNames that receives a List<String> and prints each name to the console.

3. Write a public method called addNumbers that takes two double numbers and returns their sum as a double.

4. Write a private method called isSystemActive that takes no parameters and returns true if the system is active, false otherwise.

5. Write a public method called repeatCharacters that takes a String and an int, and returns a List<Character> containing the characters of the string repeated the given number of times.

6. Write a private method called showWelcomeMessage that takes no parameters and displays a welcome message on the console.

7. Write a public method called joinStrings that takes an array of String objects and returns a single String with all the elements joined together.

8. Write a private method called filterBelowThreshold that takes a List<Integer> and an int threshold and removes all numbers below the threshold from the list.
