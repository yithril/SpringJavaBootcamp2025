For this morning's warmup, we're going to use premade code to write unit tests.
Please take the Warmup project folder and COPY it to your computer (don't move it, copy/paste it please)
You can put it in your warmup or code along folder. Then, in IntelliJ open up the warmup folder
after you've moved it.

You'll see a BankAccount class. I'm going to have you test it out. You will need to generate a test class and install JUnit which
we learned in class on Wednesday.

The functionality we need to test is:

1. Depositing money
2. Withdrawing money

Our bank has a policy of charging an overdraft fee if a user withdraws an amount that would make their balance
negative. We also do not allow a user to withdraw money if it would bring their account to less than -200 (before overdraft is applied).

Do NOT change any code in the BankAccount class.

You will need to write unit tests to handle scenarios where the user deposits a positive amount of money, and the different
scenarios for withdrawing money.

EXTRA CREDIT: 
What happens if the user tries to deposit a negative amount of money? What does the code say to do?

Write a unit test to check that calling
deposit(-50) throws an IllegalArgumentException.
Hint: Look into assertThrows in JUnit 5.
