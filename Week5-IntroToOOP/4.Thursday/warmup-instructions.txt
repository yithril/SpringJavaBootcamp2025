For this morning's warmup, we're going to use premade code to write unit tests.
Please take the Warmup project folder and COPY it to your computer (don't move it, copy/paste it please)
You can put it in your warmup or code along folder. Then, in IntelliJ open up the warmup folder
after you've moved it.

You'll see a BankAccount class. I'm going to have you test it out. You will need to generate a test class and install JUnit which
we learned in class on Wednesday.

The functionality we need to test is:

1. Depositing money
2. Withdrawing money

Our bank has a policy of charging an overdraft fee if a user withdraws an amount that would make their balance
negative. We also do not allow a user to withdraw money if it would bring their account to less than -200 (before overdraft is applied).

You will need to write unit tests to handle these scenarios. I am not going to spell out all the scenarios, you'll need
to figure them out, and then write appropriate unit tests using Arrange-Act-Assert.
