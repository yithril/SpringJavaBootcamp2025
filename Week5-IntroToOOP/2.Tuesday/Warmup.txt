We are making a simple program for a movie theater. We have these classes:

    Movie: holds information about a movie (title, rating, runtime)

    Theater: holds info about the theater (theater number, list of seats)

    Seat: represents a single seat (seat number, whether itâ€™s taken)

    Ticket: represents a ticket for a specific movie, theater, and seat

1. Where should we store the title and runtime of the movie?
2. Where should we keep track of whether a seat is available or taken?
3. Who should be responsible for assigning a specific seat when someone buys a ticket?
4. When we print the ticket, where do we get the info for:

    Movie name
    Theater number
    Seat number

5. The Seat class has a Boolean property named: isTaken. Should other classes just flip that value directly, or should we hide it and give them a method like markAsTaken()? Why or why not?
