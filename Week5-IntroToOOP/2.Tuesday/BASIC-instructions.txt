BASIC Code Reading Activity: Movie Theater Program
Instructions:

Today we are doing a “theater of the mind” activity.
Your goal is to read through the BASIC code and imagine the flow of the program as if it is running.

    Start at the top of the code and follow along in line number order.

    Every time you see a GOTO, pause and figure out where the program jumps to next.

    Your job is to simulate the program in your mind and be ready to explain what happens step by step.

We will practice leading each other through the flow of the program by tracing which lines the computer would run for different choices.
Questions to Answer:

    What does GOTO do in this program? Why is it important?

    When the user picks Movie 1:

        What information is shown?

        Where does the program jump next?

    When the user picks Movie 2:

        Is there repeated code between Movie 1 and Movie 2?

    How does the program handle ticket purchases?

        What happens if the user tries to buy more tickets than are available?

    How is the total price calculated?

        Is the logic stored in one spot, or duplicated?

Reflection:

    Would it be simple or difficult to add a third movie? Why?

    What challenges do you notice about how the program moves between sections?

After you finish, we will walk through the code together as a class and discuss how modern programming (methods and classes) solve these problems.
