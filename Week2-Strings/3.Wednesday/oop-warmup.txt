Java Warm-Up: Appointment Class
Today, you will design a class that models a real-life scenario: scheduling an appointment. This activity will help you practice building classes, creating multiple constructors, 
and designing a simple custom method.

Scenario:
You're helping build a scheduling system for a local business. Sometimes, appointments are fully scheduled with a date and time. Other times, someone calls in and just wants to 
request a service â€” without finalizing a time yet.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Create a class called Appointment with the following private fields:
String clientName

String date (e.g., "2025-04-16")

String time (e.g., "10:30 AM")

String serviceType (e.g., "Checkup", "Haircut", "Math Tutoring")

2. Use IntelliJ's generator to:
Create a constructor with all four fields.

Generate getters and setters for all fields.

3. Add a second constructor (write this yourself):
Imagine this scenario:

A client calls and wants to request a service but isn't ready to set a date and time yet. You only collect their name and the service type.

Write a second constructor that takes only clientName and serviceType.

Challenge #1
In this constructor, set date and time to "TBD" because we never got that information from the customer (How would you do this?)

Challenge #2

Description:
This method should return true if the appointment has both a confirmed date and time (i.e., not "TBD"). Otherwise, it should return false.
HINT: If the appointment has no date and no time...then what would be the value of the date and time properties?
