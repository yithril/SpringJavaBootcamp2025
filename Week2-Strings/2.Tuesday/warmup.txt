Java Warm-Up: String Method Review

Instructions:
1. Create a new IntelliJ project in your warmup folder called StringWarmup.
2. In the main method, complete the following steps using the string methods: trim, toUpperCase, toLowerCase, and length.

Tasks:
- Create a string called messyString with this value (yes, keep the extra white space):
     "   Hello Java Students!   "
- Print the original string and its length.
- Use trim() to remove extra spaces. Print the trimmed string and its new length.
- Convert the trimmed string to all uppercase and print the result.
- Convert the trimmed string to all lowercase and print the result.

Comment Questions (write your answers as comments in the code):
1. What did trim() do to the string?
2. What is the difference between toUpperCase() and toLowerCase()?
3. Why did the length change after using trim()?
